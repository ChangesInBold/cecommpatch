	Balance notes:
		* happiness: baseline of 50
			Values of 25 are assumed to be baseline (so as to fit with the workshift system).
			Higher than 25 is happier than average, lower is distinctly unhappy.
			
		* anger: baseline of 25
			Values of above 50 will promote destructive behaviour.
			Anything from 0-49 will actually inhibit destructive behaviour.
			(Yes, it's a blunt instrument right now)
			
		* despair: baseline of 25
			This combines madness and sadness.
			
		* afraid: baseline of 25
			TODO : will be connected to concept of combat morale
