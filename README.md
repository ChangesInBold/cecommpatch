Clockwork Empires Community Patch

This is a project to create a community patch for the game Clockwork Empires. Our goal is to fix all bugs that the exposed files allow. This is not a reverse engineering, piracy, or hacking project.

The MASTER branch is currently the default (unchanged) files that are currently being edited.
The "v1" branch contains all current changes and can be applied to the game, but they are untested so use with caution. Once tested, they will be merged.

To restore the original files of an edited game, simply "verify integrity of cache" in Steam and the originals will be redownloaded.
